- The script learns the DDoS Protection of the IPv4 address to which the attack will be performed, imitates the requests to the device where the DDoS Protection is made and sends the packets to the server.
- But to use it, it must be active on your IPHM (IP Spoofing) Server

- Usage :
- Connect Your VPS
- And Send Commands
- git clone [https://github.com/RootPace/discord-ddos-script.git](https://github.com/EndlessXD/DDos-Switch-Request-Spoofing)
- cd DDos-Switch-Request-Spoofing
- chmod +x SwitchSpoofer
- ./SwitchSpoofer start
- Type the server information requested from you and start the attack
